Seismic amplitude ratio analysis (SARA) has been used successfully to
track the sub-surface migration of magma prior to an eruption at Piton de
la Fournaise volcano, La Reunion. The methodology is based on the temporal
analysis of the seismic amplitude ratio between different pairs of stations,
along with a model of seismic wave attenuation. This method has already
highlighted the complexity of magma migration in the shallower part of the
volcanic edifice during a seismic crisis using continuous records. We will
see that this method can also be applied to the localization of individual
earthquakes triggered by monitoring systems, prior to human intervention
such as phase picking.
